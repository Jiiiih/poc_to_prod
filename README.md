## ATENTION
I could not launch my app.py because it could not find the preprocessing module, also I could not launch script individually because of the same mistake. With the newly created environment I still had modules that were not recognized. I coded what I think would have work. I could not resolve this issue in time and furthermore I noticed it too late when courses ended so I could not ask for your help I also had issue with Pycharm which incited me to stay on VS code. Sorry for the disgrament and I hope it will not impact the correction too much. I still could launch the tests with the base environment.
